# go-aoc
An attempt at making a CLI tool that manages all tasks for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) that starts on December 1, every year. Name **not** final.

## Current State
Currently, the program is not operational and is just a simple HTML2MDX parser that converts the problem webpages to MDX files that can be stored as MDX files.

Eventually, the goal of this tool is to make fetching problems, testing and benchmarking submissions, and submitting into a universal CLI.

Many such tools already exist, however, this is attempt to master Go via a small scale project.

## Plan
- [ ] Fetching questions
- [ ] Folder structure for multiple years
- [ ] Testing submissions written in Go
- [ ] Submitting solutions and feedback relay from the actual website
- [ ] Recording execution times in case of multiple solutions

These are high level goals that are planned to be completed before 1 December. Refined goals will be updated as I write the tool and flush out the features.

## Contributions
Although this is a personal project to learn Go, I encourage and appreciate any contributions. Just open a PR!
